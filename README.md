# Assignments for STAT-4001-Statistical-Learning using R

This repository is a collection of R notebooks files regarding STAT 4001: Statistical Learning and Data Mining course. This course was taken in the first term of 2023.

In this course, I had experience of designing and structuring algorithms used in machine learning from scratch and also use various libraries to apply machine learning methods to make predictions. Please find below for more information

- Use Newton's Method to maximize log likelihood of logistic regression
- Construct K-means and K-medoids clustering algorithms from scratch
- Construct Cyclical Coordinate Descent algorithm to find optimal parameter values of a lasso regression model
- Use Bootstrapping method to calculate confidence intervals of a statistic
- Apply Cross Validation methods to choose optimal parameters and hyperparameters
- Fit polynomial regression, ridge regression, regression trees, and random forests using various libraries in R
- Explore boosting methods
